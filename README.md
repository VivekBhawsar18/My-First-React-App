# My First React Todo App

Welcome to my first React Todo App! This simple application allows you to save, display, and delete todos along with their descriptions. The todos are stored in your browser's local storage, so you can access them even after closing the app.

## Features
- **Add Todo**: You can easily add new todos by entering a title and description.
- **Display Todos**: View all your saved todos with their titles and descriptions.
- **Delete Todo**: Remove any todo from the list if it's no longer needed.

## Demo
